# e-commerce-site

## Description
This program utilizes ORM to generate the back end for an e-commerce site. Creating this project is a huge help to give me a greater understanding of routing, models, and using Insomnia in a demonstrative way. This program is a good way to help visualize the back end for a website with large amounts of intractable data and how to organize it.
